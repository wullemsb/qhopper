After you have made a successful connection, you should be able to see your vhosts and queues in the sidebar. Refresh rate will be set OFF as default. This is only for refreshing the sidebar, not the messages.

### Selecting Multiple Messages
You can select multiple messages by holding the shift key:

- If you check one checkbox, hold the shift key, and then select another checkbox, it will select everything in between.
- If you haven't selected any checkboxes, hold the shift key and select a checkbox, it will select everything from the beginning to that checkbox.
